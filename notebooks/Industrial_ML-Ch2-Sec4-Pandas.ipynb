Pandas\n","\n","Use the `df_trans` DataFrame created in this notebook (our industrial dataset) to solve the tasks below.  \n","These exercises cover concepts from Sections 4.1–4.7 and will help consolidate your learning.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### 1. Basic Exploration\n","- Display the first 10 rows and check column data types.\n","- Check for missing values in all columns.\n","- Compute basic statistics (mean, min, max) for numeric columns.\n","\n","#### 2. Column Operations\n","- Rename `'Energy'` → `'Energy_kWh'`.\n","- Create a new column `'Temp_F'` converting `'Temperature'` to Fahrenheit.\n","- Create a flag column `'High_Energy'` for rows where `'Energy_kWh' > 400`.\n","\n","#### 3. Handling Missing Data\n","- Introduce some NaNs in `'Temperature'` and `'Energy_kWh'` (e.g., every 60th row).\n","- Fill NaNs in `'Temperature'` with the column mean.\n","- Drop rows where `'Energy_kWh'` is NaN.\n","\n","#### 4. String & Text Processing\n","- Clean the `'Region'` column (strip spaces, lowercase, replace `'region_'` with `'Region'`).\n","- Create a new column `'Machine_Type'` based on `'Machine'` (e.g., extract `'Motor'`, `'Fan'`, etc.).\n","\n","#### 5. Grouping & Aggregation\n","- Compute total and average energy per `'Machine'`.\n","- Count the number of faults per `'Region'`.\n","- Compute standard deviation and variance of `'Temperature'` per `'Region'`.\n","- Rank machines by average daily energy consumption.\n","- Filter groups to keep only regions with more than 100 samples.\n","\n","#### 6. Concatenation & Merging\n","- Create a small DataFrame with last maintenance dates for some machines.\n","- Merge it with `df_trans` on `'Machine'` using a left join.\n","- Concatenate a subset of `df_trans` (e.g., first 5 rows) to itself vertically.\n","\n","#### 7. Sorting & Ranking\n","- Sort `df_trans` by `'Energy_kWh'` descending.\n","- Sort `df_trans` by `'Region'` and then `'Temperature'` ascending.\n","- Create a new column `'Energy_Rank_Global'` ranking all rows by `'Energy_kWh'`.\n","- Create a new column `'Energy_Rank_Daily'` ranking rows within each day.\n","\n","#### 8. Loading & Saving Data\n","- Try modifying `big_df` (e.g., adding missing values, new columns) and save it again.\n","- Compare the differences in types when reading/writing CSV, Excel, and `.mat`.\n","- Combine this with the data cleaning and transformation tools learned in previous subsections.\n","\n","#### 9. Optional: Your Choice Function\n","- Apply one additional GroupBy function of your choice (e.g., `nunique`, `cumsum`, `first`) to explore.\n","- Explain in a comment why you chose this function.\n","\n","---\n","\n","💡 **Hints:**  \n","Use pandas methods such as:\n","- `head()`, `info()`, `describe()`, `dtypes`  \n","- `rename()`, `astype()`, `apply()`, `str.strip()`, `str.lower()`, `str.replace()`  \n","- `isnull()`, `fillna()`, `dropna()`  \n","- `groupby()`, `agg()`, `transform()`, `filter()`, `rank()`  \n","- `merge()`, `join()`, `concat()`  \n","- `sort_values()`, `sort_index()`"],"metadata":{"id":"xWgutgiYMhPd"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Next → **Section 5: Data Visualization**"],"metadata":{"id":"FeJ8lpNxf1Ys"}}]}
