Explanation for Students\n","\n","In real-world ML workflows, arrays often represent datasets where **rows are samples** and **columns are features**.  \n","\n","- `reshape` lets you convert between different shapes, for example, flattening a 2D image array into a 1D vector for a model.  \n","- `transpose` swaps rows and columns, which can be useful when aligning datasets for matrix operations.  \n","- `concatenate` and `stack` help combine multiple datasets, e.g., merging feature sets or appending new samples.  \n","- `split` allows dividing a dataset into training and testing subsets.  \n","- `flipud` and `fliplr` are helpful in image processing or data augmentation tasks.  \n","\n","These operations are not just abstract—they are **practical tools** you will use repeatedly when
