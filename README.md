# Industrial Applications of Machine Learning

This repository provides the complete teaching materials and example Jupyter notebooks for the MSc course **“Industrial Applications of Machine Learning.”**  
The course demonstrates how modern machine learning and deep learning methods can be applied to real-world industrial problems — with a strong emphasis on **practical, hands-on learning**.

---

## 🎯 Course Objectives
- Introduce key ML and DL concepts in an **industrial context**  
- Provide **practical experience** through coding, labs, and assignments  
- Bridge the gap between **theory and real-world applications**  
- Prepare students for **research and deployment** of ML solutions in industry

## 📁 Repository Structure
- **Slides/** – Lecture slides in PDF format  
- **Notebooks/** – Jupyter notebooks used in lectures, labs, and case studies  
- **README.md** – Course overview and usage guide  

> 🗂️ **Note:**  
> The datasets used in these notebooks are **not included** in the repository.  
> Each notebook specifies how to obtain or download the required data (e.g., from public repositories or industrial partners).  
> Likewise, any generated outputs such as models, figures, or logs are produced locally when running the notebooks.
